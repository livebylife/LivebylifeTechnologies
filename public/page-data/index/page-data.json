We do what is called decouple with WordPress and WooCommerce and use blazing fast front end frameworks made possible with JAMstack (JavaScript, API's, and Markup) technologies.</p>\n\n<p>The advantages of Headless Development</p>\n\n<h3>1. Security</h3>\n\n<p>With the use of a Jamstack, there are fewer points of failure. The infrastructure we use delivers content that has been rendered server-side, as such everything we deliver to the browser can be cached or distributed via content delivery networks (CDN). </p>\n\n<p>As a result of this architecture, we leverage the security of multiple systems. Our chosen providers for content delivery and content distribution network are industry leaders and as such have multiple levels of security for their platforms and large teams of cybersecurity experts. </p>\n\n<h3>2. Scalability</h3>\n\n<p>With sites being served entirely from a CDN there is no complex logic to determine asset caching policy, we do not need to selectively cache and serve content, everything can be served from a cache. </p>\n\n<p>This allows for simpler deployments and faster workflows when implementing new features or adding new content. </p>\n\n<h3>3. Maintainability</h3>\n\n<p>When hosting complexity is reduced and so are the tasks required to carry out maintenance on a system. </p>\n\n<p>Due to the decoupled nature of Jamstack architecture, the content is secure on the content platform and the project code that renders the content sits separately from the content. As a result, we don’t require complicated back-end integrations and can quickly carry out changes and amendments to a platform with minimal testing. </p>\n\n<p>There are no complex databases to manage only the content and how it’s rendered. We don’t have to carry out updates or patches to plug security issues, once a site is built and served it’s stable. </p>\n\n<h3>4. Performance</h3>\n\n<p>Performance is an important metric for SEO and as such modern platforms need to be built with performance in mind from the ground up. Page loading speeds have a huge impact on conversion and user experience. </p>\n\n<p>With Jamstack architecture and content being served from a CDN, the content is readily available close to the end-user ready to be served. High performance is the result of this method without introducing expensive infrastructure costs. </p>\n\n<h3>5. Portability</h3>\n\n<p>As the content is decoupled it can be used anywhere, meaning we can plug content from a singular system into multiple platforms across an array of end-use cases. This includes serving content to internal closed systems, public-facing websites or even apps. </p>\n\n<p>We can also host our platforms on a variety of services and have greater flexibility in moving things around.</p>"},"field_domain_service_slug":{"processed":"Reach more customers easily with our managed eCommerce

Instead, passwordless authentication systems typically use alternative methods of verifying the identity of the user, such as biometrics, security tokens, or one-time codes sent to the user's phone or email.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goal of passwordless authentication is to improve the security and user experience of traditional authentication systems. By eliminating the need for users to remember and manage complex passwords, passwordless authentication can help to reduce the risk of password-related security breaches, such as password reuse and weak password practices. Additionally, passwordless authentication can make it easier and more convenient for users to access systems and services, as they no longer need to remember and enter a password.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several different approaches to passwordless authentication, and the specific approach that is used will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the system. Some common passwordless authentication methods include biometric authentication, security tokens, one-time codes sent via SMS or email, and passwordless logins using third-party authentication providers such as Google or Facebook. Overall, passwordless authentication can provide many benefits, but it is important to carefully consider the specific security and user experience implications of using this approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does going Passwordless offer more security</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Going passwordless, or using alternative methods of authentication such as biometrics or security tokens, can offer some benefits in terms of security. Traditional password-based authentication systems can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, including brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and phishing scams. By using alternative authentication methods, it is possible to reduce the risk of these attacks and to improve the overall security of the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is important to note that going passwordless does not necessarily guarantee improved security. Other factors, such as the quality and robustness of the authentication methods that are used, the security of the underlying infrastructure, and the overall security practices of the organization, can also play a role in the overall security of the system. Additionally, some passwordless authentication methods, such as biometrics, can be vulnerable to different types of attacks and may not provide the same level of security as traditional password-based systems. In general, the decision to go passwordless should be carefully considered and should be based on a thorough analysis of the specific security requirements and risks of the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the benefits of going Passwordless?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several potential benefits to going passwordless, or using alternative methods of authentication in place of traditional password-based systems. Some of the key benefits of going passwordless include improved security, improved user experience, and reduced administrative overhead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main benefits of going passwordless is improved security. Traditional password-based authentication systems can be vulnerable to a variety of attacks, such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and phishing scams. By using alternative authentication methods, such as biometrics or security tokens, it is possible to reduce the risk of these attacks and to improve the overall security of the system. Additionally, passwordless authentication can help to reduce the risk of password-related security breaches, such as password reuse and weak password practices, which can be a significant source of security vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another benefit of going passwordless is improved user experience. Passwordless authentication systems can make it easier and more convenient for users to access systems and services, as they no longer need to remember and enter complex passwords. This can save users time and frustration and can make it more likely that they will use the system or service on a regular basis. Additionally, passwordless authentication can provide a more seamless and secure user experience, as users are not required to enter or manage passwords and can instead use biometrics or other authentication methods that are easy and intuitive to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, going passwordless can also provide benefits in terms of reduced administrative overhead. Traditional password-based authentication systems can require significant amounts of administrative effort, including password resets, password expiration, and password synchronization across different systems and services. By using passwordless authentication methods, it is possible to reduce or eliminate many of these administrative tasks, which can save time and resources and reduce the overall complexity of the system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the benefits of going passwordless can vary depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the system. It is important to carefully consider the potential benefits and trade-offs of using passwordless authentication and to choose the approach that is best suited to your specific needs and goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"},"relationships":{"field_book_image_s_":[],"field_feature_":null}},{"drupal_internal__book":null,"drupal_internal__nid":37,"title":"Keeping up to date","body":{"value":"<p>Here we will discuss the importance of keeping up to date on applications and plugins.

Russian security vendor, Doctor Web, reported that if a site is using outdated versions of these add-ons that lack crucial fixes, the targeted web pages are injected with malicious JavaScripts. This results in users being redirected to other sites when they click on any area of an attack page. The attacks involve using a list of known security vulnerabilities in 19 different plugins and themes, which are likely installed on a WordPress site, to deploy an implant that can target a specific website and further expand the network. The malware is also capable of injecting JavaScript code retrieved from a remote server in order to redirect site visitors to an arbitrary website chosen by the attacker. Doctor Web identified a second version of the backdoor that uses a new command-and-control domain and an updated list of flaws spanning 11 additional plugins, bringing the total to 30. WordPress users are advised to keep all components of the platform up-to-date, including third-party add-ons and themes, and to use strong and unique logins and passwords to secure their accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>This is just an example of how, we have seen a rise in the use of botnets by cybercriminals to carry out a variety of malicious activities. A botnet is a network of private computers that have been infected with malicious software and are controlled as a group by a third party without the owners' knowledge. These botnets can be used for activities such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spamming, data theft, and cryptocurrency mining.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>As a business owner, it's important to be aware of the threat that botnets pose to your website and applications. If your business falls victim to a botnet attack, it can result in financial losses, damage to your company's reputation, and disruption of the normal functioning of your business.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>In this article, we will discuss the rise of botnets and what you can do to protect your business website and applications from this growing threat. By following best practices and implementing the right cybersecurity measures, you can reduce the risk of a botnet attack and keep your business safe.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>Botnet attacks can have serious consequences for businesses of all sizes. If your business falls victim to a botnet attack, it can result in financial losses, damage to your company's reputation, and disruption of the normal functioning of your business.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>One of the main ways that botnets can cause financial losses is through distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. In a DDoS attack, a botnet is used to flood a website or online service with traffic, making it unavailable to users. This can result in lost revenue, as customers are unable to access the service or make purchases.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>In addition to financial losses, a botnet attack can also damage your company's reputation. If customers are unable to access your website or service due to a botnet attack, they may perceive your business as unreliable or untrustworthy. This can lead to a loss of customer confidence and a decrease in business.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>Finally, a botnet attack can disrupt the normal functioning of your business. If your website or service is unavailable due to an attack, it can disrupt your operations and make it difficult for your employees to do their job. This can have a ripple effect on your business, leading to lost productivity and further financial losses.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>To protect your business from the consequences of a botnet attack, it's important to educate yourself about the risks and take the necessary precautions. This includes implementing strong cybersecurity measures, such as using firewalls and antivirus software, and regularly updating systems and software. It's also important to be cautious when clicking links or downloading attachments and to use strong and unique passwords. By staying vigilant and taking the right precautions, you can help to reduce the risk of a botnet attack and protect your business from financial losses, damage to your reputation, and disruption of your operations.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>But what exactly is a botnet? Simply put, it's a network of private computers that have been infected with malicious software and are controlled as a group by a third party without the owners' knowledge. The computers in a botnet are often referred to as \"bots\" and the process of compromising them is known as \"botting\".</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>Botnets can be used for a variety of nefarious purposes, such as distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spamming, data theft, cryptocurrency mining, and click fraud. These activities can not only disrupt the normal functioning of your business, but also result in financial losses and damage to your company's reputation.</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>So, how can you protect your business from botnets? Here are a few steps you can take:</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Implement strong cybersecurity measures: This includes using firewalls, antivirus software, and regularly updating your systems and software.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Educate your employees: Make sure your employees are aware of the risks of botnets and teach them how to identify and avoid potential threats. This includes caution when clicking links or downloading attachments and using strong and unique passwords.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Monitor your network: Use monitoring tools to keep track of your network activity and detect any unusual behavior. This can help you to quickly identify and respond to any potential threats.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Stay up to date: Keep track of the latest threats and vulnerabilities and make sure to apply any necessary updates or patches to your systems and software.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Use strong passwords: Use complex, unique passwords for all of your accounts and devices, and consider using a password manager to generate and store them securely.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Be cautious when clicking links or downloading attachments: Be wary of suspicious emails and avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</span></span></span></li>\r\n\t<li><span><span><span>Consider using a managed security service: If you do not have the resources</span></span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><span><span><span>By following these best practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of your business falling victim to a botnet attack. Stay vigilant and stay protected.</span></span></span></p>\r\n"},"relationships":{"field_book_image_s_":[],"field_feature_":null}},{"drupal_internal__book":{"bid":"28","nid":"28","pid":"0","depth":"1","p1":"28","p2":"0","p3":"0","p4":"0","p5":"0","p6":"0","p7":"0","p8":"0","p9":"0"},"drupal_internal__nid":28,"title":"Modern small business technology tools","body":{"value":"<p>Small businesses around the world are constantly seeking ways to improve efficiency and boost productivity.

Tools","body":{"value":"<p>It is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of the amount of time that workers spend managing their tasks as it will vary depending on a number of factors such as the complexity of the tasks, the number of tasks being managed, and the efficiency of the worker. However, it is generally expected that workers will spend at least some portion of their time organizing, prioritizing, and scheduling their tasks. Some studies have estimated that workers spend an average of 28% of their workweek on task management, but this will vary depending on the specific role and industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Task management is an essential skill in today's fast-paced and ever-changing world. It allows individuals and teams to efficiently plan, organize, and execute tasks, leading to increased productivity and achievement of goals. Effective task management involves identifying and prioritizing tasks, setting deadlines, and organizing and tracking progress. It also involves adapting to changes and adjusting plans as necessary. By implementing good task management practices, individuals and teams can overcome obstacles and achieve success in both their personal and professional lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few techniques that you might find helpful for becoming more efficient with task management:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Prioritization: Focus on the most important tasks first, and try to knock out the easier ones as soon as you can to get them out of the way.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Effective task management is crucial for achieving your goals, both personal and professional. One key aspect of task management is prioritization, which involves deciding which tasks are most important and should be completed first.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>There are a few different approaches you can use to prioritize your tasks. One popular method is the Eisenhower Matrix, named after former U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower. This matrix categorizes tasks based on their importance and urgency. Tasks that are both important and urgent should be completed first, followed by important but not urgent tasks. Tasks that are neither important nor urgent can be delegated or eliminated.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Another approach is the ABCDE method, which involves assigning a letter to each task based on its importance. \"A\" tasks are the most important and should be completed first, followed by \"B\" tasks, and so on. This method allows you to prioritize tasks within each category, so you can focus on the most important tasks first.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>It's also important to consider the effort required for each task. Some tasks may be quick and easy to complete, while others may be more time-consuming. By considering the effort required for each task, you can prioritize the tasks that will have the greatest impact on your goals.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>It's also helpful to review and adjust your priorities regularly. Things can change quickly, and it's important to make sure you're still focusing on the most important tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Overall, prioritization is a key part of effective task management. By considering the importance, urgency, and effort required for each task, you can ensure that you're focusing on the things that matter most and making progress towards your goals.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Time blocking: Set aside specific blocks of time for specific tasks, rather than trying to switch between tasks constantly.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Time blocking is a task management technique that involves setting aside specific blocks of time to focus on specific tasks. It can be an effective way to increase productivity and get more done in less time.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>To use time blocking, you'll need to first create a list of all the tasks you need to complete. Next, divide your day into blocks of time and assign specific tasks to each block. For example, you might set aside the first two hours of the day to work on a high-priority project, followed by a break, then another two hours of work on a different task.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>One of the benefits of time blocking is that it helps you stay focused and avoid distractions. When you're working on a specific task during a designated block of time, you're less likely to get sidetracked by emails or social media notifications.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Time blocking can also help you manage your energy levels more effectively. By scheduling tasks that require more mental energy during your most productive times of day, you can work more efficiently and avoid burnout.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>It's important to be flexible with your time blocks and adjust them as needed. If a task takes longer than expected, you may need to adjust your schedule to make room for it. Similarly, if you finish a task earlier than expected, you can either take a break or move on to the next task on your list.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Overall, time blocking is a powerful task management tool that can help you stay focused, increase your productivity, and get more done in less time.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The Pomodoro Technique: Work for a set amount of time (usually 25 minutes) and then take a short break (usually 5 minutes). Repeat this process a few times before taking a longer break.<br />\r\n\t&nbsp;</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>The Eisenhower Method: Sort your tasks into four categories: important and urgent, important but not urgent, not important but urgent, and not important and not urgent. Focus on the tasks in the first two categories first, and then tackle the others as you have time.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>To-do lists: Keep a written list of your tasks, and break larger tasks into smaller, more manageable ones. Check off items as you complete them to give yourself a sense of progress.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Collaboration tools: Use tools like Trello, Asana, or Google Docs to collaborate with team members and keep track of tasks.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Delegation: If you have too many tasks on your plate, consider delegating some of them to other team members. This can free up your time to focus on the tasks that only you can do.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p>Time tracking: Use a tool like Toggl or Harvest to track how much time you spend on each task. This can help you identify areas where you might be able to streamline your workflow.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Task management tools are an essential part of modern workflows, helping individuals and teams to stay organized, focused, and productive. Whether you are a freelancer working on your own projects, or part of a large organization with many ongoing tasks, a task management tool can help you to stay on top of your responsibilities and achieve your goals. However, to get the most out of a task management tool, it is important to follow some guidelines to ensure that you are using the tool effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First and foremost, it is important to have a clear understanding of what tasks you need to complete, and how they fit into your overall goals. Before you start using a task management tool, take some time to define your objectives and create a list of the tasks that you need to complete in order to achieve them. This will help you to stay focused and avoid getting sidetracked by unnecessary tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have a clear idea of what needs to be done, you can start organizing your tasks in your task management tool. Many tools allow you to create different projects and lists to help you categorize your tasks and keep them organized. You can also use labels or tags to further categorize your tasks and make them easier to find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you work on your tasks, it is important to keep them up to date and accurate. Make sure that you regularly review your task list and update the status of your tasks as you complete them. This will help you to keep track of your progress and identify any tasks that may have fallen through the cracks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effective task management also involves setting priorities and deadlines. Not all tasks are created equal, and it is important to identify which tasks are most important and need to be completed first. You can use your task management tool to set due dates and priorities for your tasks, helping you to stay on track and avoid falling behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another key aspect of effective task management is communication and collaboration. Whether you are working on your own or as part of a team, it is important to keep everyone informed and involved in the process. Many task management tools include features such as chat, file sharing, and real-time updates, which can help you to stay connected with your team and share information about your tasks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I use Restyaboard at Live By Life Technologies to manage tasks and stay organized. The tool helps me keep track of ongoing projects and to-do lists, and allows us to move tasks through different stages of completion. By using this task management tool I now have a clearer understanding of my tasks, able organize them effectively, keep them up to date, set priorities and deadlines, and stay connected with my team, helping me effectively manage my tasks and achieve my goals.</p>\r\n"},"relationships":{"field_book_image_s_":[],"field_feature_":null}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"],"slicesMap":{}}
