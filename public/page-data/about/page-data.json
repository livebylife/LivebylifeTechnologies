I'm <strong>Matt</strong>, I program web things like websites, application programming interfaces (API's), mobile applications, front-end, back-end, internet of things (IoT), data management, reporting and collection. This means I help companies prototype and launch faster.</p>\n\n<p>Life is about change so let's program it ourselves taking advantage of the latest technologies, stacks, libraries, frameworks, and fundamentals let's ride the waves of change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Livebylife Technologies?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Timeliness</strong> - I'm a big fan of design sprints and agile methodologies so that every project is completed quickly and professionally.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Quality</strong> – I like to measure quality of projects by the “Quality in Use” Model (ISO/IEC 25010:2011) Software Quality Model: Effectiveness, Efficiency, Satisfaction, Safety, Usability</p>\n\n<p><strong>Financially resolute</strong> – Expenses for any project can become outrageous if not for budgets. Projects running at budget and have low maintenance expenditures are set up to excel. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Flexibility</strong> – Flexible boundaries within app development to ensure successful execution of projects. I follow the three pillars of project management and product development – Time, Scope, and Cost. Flexibility holds these together to form a quality product. Too rigid a project and the more it resists change will cause it to break under pressure like brittle glass.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Industry Proficiencies</strong>      </p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Hospitality &amp; Tourism</li>\n\t<li>Construction</li>\n\t<li>Small Business / Entrepreneurship</li>\n\t<li>Energy and Mining Operations</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doodle.com/meeting/participate/id/dGZ6v5Qb/vote\">Book a Free Consultation</a></p>"}}]}},"allNodeParallaxDivider":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Index","relationships":{"field_parallax_image":[{"uri":{"url":"/sites/default/files/2022-05/elephant-2380009_1920.jpg"}},{"uri":{"url":"/sites/default/files/2022-05/lake-192990_1280.jpg"}},{"uri":{"url":"/sites/default/files/2022-05/earth-2254769_1920.jpg"}},{"uri":{"url":"/sites/default/files/2022-05/pexels-pixabay-248515.jpg"}}]}}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3000541721"]}
